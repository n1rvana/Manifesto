Manifesto
=========

How software startups should operate.


Management
==========
First, a brief digression....

All nerds should read this: http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/silicon-valley-may-not-be-fixable/

20+ years expereince in startups has taught me one thing: non-technical people cannot successfully run tech companies.  Whereby "succes" I mean "the company succeeds due to its product."  
Current silicon valley culture defines success as an "aquihire" or a "biz-engineered-competitive-merger".  This latter is what happens when a large company buys a small company that is disrupting its space.  If the small company is successfully disrupting, why did it sell out?  It could only become more valuable over time.  
The answer to that is simple: Most of this success is fake, as silicon valley has a "fake it until you make it" cover.  Using VC capital to unprofitably buy revenues to enable raising even more VC capital at a valuation of a high multiple of revenues is just good business sense when your primary product is the companie's stock, not the BS app everyone thinks is your product. 

So, the first rule of this manifesto is this:
- The top dog will be an engineer.  
  - A real engineer.  This includes the likes of Gates and Jobs both of whom can code
  - Engineers can learn business.  Business is easy.
  - Connections are useful if your currency is pull, but if you're building a product, you can generate your own connections.
  - Technologists, such as Tim Cook are acceptable. But note that Tim Cook spent decades mastering worldwide supply chain management before leading a company. Hiring an MBA in the bottom half of their class (eg: the typical Silicon Valley CEO) is not the same thing.
- Business people can be on the board, only if they have at least 15 years experience in a key operational area of the company. 
- Technologists, Engineers, Operations and Product people must have a majority of the voting power of the board of directors.  If your VC wants a seat, they better put up a competent engineer for it, and really should be extending your runway by close to %80 or more.

Meetings
========

- All Meetings are optional, and open door.  This encourages brevety, and transparency.
  - Long term planning is open to all stakeholders.
  - The only exception are specific personnel issues.  

Responsibility
==============

  - Responsibility always has authority attached
  - Someone is responsible for everything.  They are accountable for the progress and quality in that area.  
  - No one person can be a silo of all the information in an area.  
  - Usually the person responsibe for the area is the one who will be doing the work and has the most on-the-ground   experience and hands-on time with that area.  
  - They must cross train another team member in that area.   
  - The person who is responsible is responsible for hearing other team members input, and making the final say if there is disagreement.

Disagreement
============

- If it can be practically measured, measure it and figure out who is right.
- When judgement calls are made, defer to experience, but the experience also acrues responsibility for the outcome.
- Someone should always have the final say, so that everything isn't always up for debate.

Hiring
======

- Hire people who have that spark in their eyes.
  - hungry: they must have an agenda of some sort, preferably aligned with the companies interests in some way
    - self-teaching: training costs two people's time, and is less effective than those who want to learn (that said, training should happen)
    - ready to do whatever is needed.  "That's not my job" is never something they'd say.
    - look for people who have accomplished something exceptional, even if it's mundane.  eg: an exceptional train set.
    - only hire programmers who program because thats the way their brain formed. don't hire those who decided in college that it was a lucrative career
    - find people who enjoy helping others. the guy who always volunteers to chip in, have that person interview each candidate to find people who think first of the team, and of themselves second
    - hire slowly, contract with potential hires at a high hourly rate, if they work out bring them on full time. (there's a special place in hell for people who do contract-to-hire at regular salary)
    - ABC: Attitude, Bandwidth, Communications - look for people with good attidue, high badwidth (eg: smart or hard worker) and good communications abilities. 

Firing
======

  - people have one boss, that is their leader. their leader must be competent in the work that they do
  - termination should never be a surprise, it should be the ultimate result of a series of attempts to correct problems
  - only the top level of a creative class reports to business (eg: the CTO's boss may not be an engineer, but all other
    engineers have someone competent in engineering as their boss)

Work Day
========

- Software development requires mental acuity.  People should work when they are well rested.  Fixed schedules undermine productivity in software. 
- interrupting engineers, especially by management when the building is not on fire is a firing offense

Vacation
========

- Vacation is a benefit, and amounts may vary.  However, once time is accrued, it is the property of the employee.  The employee can take vacation whenever convenient to them.  If it is inconvenient to the company, they owe the employee compensation (in the form of additional vacation time) for changing the vacation dates.
  
Planning
========

- Choose one: Maximum productivity or hitting specific dates.  
- Choose one: The product you want, or the product you think you want at the beginning of the project.
  
  - Maximum productivity requires working on what's most important at the time when you have maximum information and focus. 
  
  - Dates always force a compromise to the product, and undermine productivity, because they cause corners to be cut to make the date.
  
  - At the same time, understanding of the market and the market itself can shift during product development.  You can't know in advance what the product will be with sufficient detail to schedule it out in advance.  And without that detail your date is arbitrary and counter-productive.
  
- On the other hand, real artists ship. 
  
- The compromise: Always be shipping.
  
  - Measure progress on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. Any more frequently and you're going to be interfering with productivity in order to have something new to report each day.
  

The Design / Development Duality
================================

  - Design is how it *works*, not how it *looks*. 
  - How it looks does, however, affect the user experience.
  - Before implementing a feature or product, it must be designed.
  
    Including:
    - software architecture
    - user experience and user interface
    - visual design
    - product market fit analysis, evaluation of go-to-market strategy and marketing plans
    - legal & business review
  
Interview Questions
===================

- What's the biggist misundersdtanding people outside *their area of expertise* have about *their area of expertise*?  - Look for PMA and ABC
